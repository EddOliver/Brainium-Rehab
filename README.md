Always use technology to improve the world, if you are a black hat or gray hat hacker please abstain at this point ......... or at least leave your star to make me feel less guilty XP.

## Introduction:

Rehabilitation system based on SmartEdge Agile

There are people in the world that suffer serious impediments in their arms. These are from several illnesses such as stroke, Guillain-Barré syndrome, paralysis from birth, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, spinal muscular atrophy and several others.
These patients have to continuously take rehabilitation therapies, which are expensive:

The prices of these sessions cost from $ 650 to $ 1300 dollars and sometimes are not insurable:

They take a lot of time and it is also necessary to go to specific clinics to receive them, which increases the pain and discomfort of the patient due to the physical effort.

The clinical devices that perform the rehabilitation are enormous and can not be transported or mobilized easily:

Therefore we must create a device capable of helping the patient in his rehabilitation, give him continuous feedback of his therapy and it has to be economical (to a certain degree and in comparison to the other choices).

## Brainium Setup:

### Model Training:

Before performing any other task, it was vital to be able to generate a model for elbow rehabilitation, the system can be extended to any rehabilitation but we chose elbow as the first sample.

4 basic movements were programmed for the rehabilitation of the elbow, of which 3 of them will be used in the final rehabilitation.

Elbow flexoextension:

This is the model that was developed and the number of repetitions for each movement:

### Widget Configuration:

Press the button to create the widget.

<img src = "https://i.ibb.co/zZSCtkK/image.png" width = "500">

We assign the model to the device.

<img src = "https://i.ibb.co/wC98Vs3/image.png" width = "500">

We create a widget as shown in the image.

<img src = "https://i.ibb.co/tD5b4F3/image.png" width = "500">

We finish the widget.

<img src = "https://i.ibb.co/dkB1cJ0/image.png" width = "500">

We will get a result like the following.

### Obtaining Credentials.

Save External access token and User ID.

## CloudMQTT Setup:

Create an account in Cloud MQTT.

https://www.cloudmqtt.com/

Copy the credentials of "Server", "User", "Password" and "Port".

## Laptop Setup:

Install Python Anaconda so that you can easily manipulate the MQTT broker, this had to be done because the Arduino library ESP32 for MQTT does not accept connectivity such as Websocket.

https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Then install this library:

    pip install paho-mqtt

Download the file Python Files, open "MQTTRehab.py" and put your credentials.

## Arm Setup:

Follow this diagram without making a mistake, IF YOU DON'T CONNECT IT WELL YOU CAN DO A SHORT CIRCUIT:

After connecting all program the ESP32 with the code in the "Arduino Files" folder.

<img src="https://www.e-ika.com/images/thumbs/0005376_placa-esp32-wifi-bluetooth_600.jpeg" width="800">

Open the "ESP32ARMRehab.ino" file and enter the CloudMQTT credentials.

    const char* ssid = "YOURSSID";
    const char* password =  "YOURPASS";
    const char* mqttServer = "m12.cloudmqtt.com";
    const int mqttPort = 12345;
    const char* mqttUser = "YOURCLOUDMQTTUSER";
    const char* mqttPassword = "YOURCLOUDMQTTPASS";
